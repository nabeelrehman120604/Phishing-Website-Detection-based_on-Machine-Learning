# 🔍 Machine Learning-Based Phishing Website Detection

A web application built with **Flask** and **Machine Learning** that detects **phishing websites** based on 30 extracted URL features — such as SSL state, domain age, subdomain structure, and request patterns.  
The system predicts whether a given website is **legitimate** or **phishing** and provides human-readable reasoning behind each prediction.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a **machine learning approach** to detect phishing websites from their URLs and domain behavior without visiting them.  
The model was trained on a balanced dataset and leverages Random Forest for high accuracy on class-imbalanced data.

### ✨ Key Features
- ✅ **URL-based detection:** No need to load the full site, reducing risk.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning model:** Trained using 30 URL features.
- 💬 **Explainable results:** Displays *why* a URL was marked as phishing (e.g., missing SSL, short domain registration, etc.).
- 🧠 **Handles missing values and class imbalance** effectively.
- 🎨 **Modern UI:** Clean HTML/CSS interface built with Flask templates.
- 👥 **Collaboration Ready:** Code structured for easy contribution.
