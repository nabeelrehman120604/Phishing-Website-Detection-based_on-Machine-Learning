# 🔍 Machine Learning-based Phishing Website Detection  

This project is a **Machine Learning-powered web application** built using **Flask** that detects whether a website is **legitimate or phishing** based on its URL.  

It uses a **Random Forest classifier** trained on **30 key features** such as SSL status, domain age, redirects, and abnormal URL structure.  
The app not only predicts if a URL is phishing but also provides **human-readable reasons** behind the detection for better understanding.
